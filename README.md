A code example of a web scraper I wrote using Ruby and the Nokogiri gem.

## parse_pages.rb
Iterates through each webpage and puts the desired data into a CSV file.

## helper_methods.rb
Methods used by the parse_pages.rb file.

## build_headers.rb
This script checks to make sure that all columns are accounted for by iterating through each page in the site.

## download_pages.rb
This script downloads all pages from each URL in a CSV file.

## find_address_2.rb
Iterates through all pages making sure none have an address line 2.
